		<h2>Profile</h2>
		I am a resourceful interaction designer that can do web development. I like to use my development skills to create useful digital products. I am competent at solving multidisciplinary problems while studying at the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University.

		<h2>Project 1 - Interface Design (IAT 334) - A3: Interactive Prototype</h2>
		<p>
			<em>Project Description:</em>
			Create with Origami studio, Supernova or other means to create a high-fidelity, multilinear interactive prototype of your interactive system.
			At a minimum, this prototype should include every step and interaction of the main features of your application.
		</p>

		<p>
			In addition, you should endeavor to complete as many other features of your application as you can in order to have a broad range of interactions and user flows available for the subsequent user testing stage.
			Your prototype will be evaluated based on design principles and components of usability you learn in the class.
			We began by deciding what our design domain was - high school teachers. We then researched about the, what are common goals of people the domain, what are some common activities,
			what are some of the technologies (including sensors), locations and situations that enable you to design a system, what challenges or opportunities in this context were interesting to our group.
			We then came up with 3 initial ideas for interactive systems that respond to these challenges/opportunities. 
			Next we did some more research and created sketches of our best idea from our initial 3.
			Following that we designed in Illustrator, 3 possible interfaces/layouts that our application could use and finalized features.
			Then we begin creating a prototype using Origami Studio.

		<h2>Project 2 - Web Design and Development (IAT 339) - P2: Company</h2>
		<p>
			<em>Project Description:</em>
			Design a company website with company updates/events, about the company, how to contact the company, a multi-product or multi-service listing, one product or service detailed view, the entire process of purchasing a product or service, appropriate means for the user to provide feedback on a product or service.
		</p>
		<p>
			We started by creating a style guide to base the website off of. We then split-up the required pages and filled in the content and styled the pages according to the style guide.
