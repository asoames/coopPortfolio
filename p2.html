					<h2>Overview:</h2>
					<p>
						In terms of 3 we designed a mobile application to help high school teacher mark assignments. The application needed to use the functionality of one of the sensors of a smartphone, in a way that helps the user achieve a task.Link to <a href="#">Link to final website [WIP]</a>

					<h2>Problem or Objective</h2>
					<p>
						Design a mobile application that helps a user in a selected design domain achieve a task. Build the application using Origami Studio to create a high-fidelity, multilinear interactive prototype of an interactive system.

					<h2>Description of Solution</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title">Research and Proposals:</h4><p>Our first step was to select a design domain. We picked high school teachers. We then did research to determine the common goal & activities of people in our domain. Following this, we came up with three initial ideas, a swipe based marking app, an app that makes taking attendance quicker by using location information & a gesture-based app for marking assignments.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title"><p> Idea and Interaction Framework:</h4>  Following feedback from our first presentation we decided to focus on creating a marking app, combining both of our ideas focusing on marking. At list point I created a basic sketch of how the app would be laid out, that would be the basis of our design going further.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title">Designing Interactions:</h4>
							<p> We then each developed a higher resolution version (for a total of 3 versions) of how the app would look/function using Illustrator & PhotoShop.</p> 
						</li>

			<div class="flex-container-p">
				<div class="flex-item">
					<ol start="4">
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title">Interactive Prototype:</h4>
							<p>Based on our feedback from our preceding presentation we selected the design that used minimal text but used icons to make functionality clear to users. I used this layout to build our first prototype using Origami Studio. Some of the roadblocks that we ran into at this stage were:</p>
							<ol class="sub-list">
								<li>
									No member of the team having an osX device, which is the only platform that Origami Studio runs on. To solve this I figured out how to get an osX virtual machine (VM) running on my computer.
								</li>
								<li>
									This, however, leads to our second roadblock, when Origami Studio runs on a VM & a keyboard is opened within the prototype it cause Origami Studio to crash. My initial idea to deal with this was to do all the prototype development using Macs at the school. However, the Macs at school did not have the drivers installed for me to be able to use my phone with them & when I asked the IT team if they could be installed, they were not allowed to do so. Along the way of this process I discovered that if I first export the files to my phone, then disconnect it from the computer, I was able to test interaction with keyboards. This definitely increased troubleshooting time because I was unable to see & modify information on-the-fly well testing. This was, however, the best solution for use, unfortunately though because of this we ran short on time & had to drop some of what we aimed to do for this check-in. We decided to focus on making sure all features were implemented for our first example assignment & leave only basic functionality for the others.
								</li>
								<li>
									From our desk critic, we learned that some of the buttons that we used we ambiguous, so we redesigned them to have a more clear function.

						First time I learned for this was the value of user testing. As soon as user testing starts, they find issues, that as the developer you don't run into. Secondly, I learned the basics of how to use Origami Studio, as I did not even know it existed prior to this class. Lastly, I learned that things will go wrong & I just need to recover as gracefully as possible & make decisions as to what is most important to complete.
