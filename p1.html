						In teams of 2 (<em>with Chris</em>), we designed a company website, with updates/events about the company, how to contact the company, a multi-product listing, a detailed view of a product, the entire process of purchasing a product and appropriate means for the user to provide feedback on a product.<br>

					<h2 class="pro-subheader amaz">Problem or Objective</h2>
					<p>
						To create a responsive shopping website, which allows customers to view updates/events, learn about the company, appropriate means for the user to provide feedback, view listings for multiple products at a time, view a detailed view of a product & a full purchasing process for the company. Post of this project, we used Git, which is for version control & co-ordinating work when not working physically with one another.

					<h2 class="pro-subheader amaz">Description of Solution</h2>
					<p>
						We began by looking at the individual projects we each did in the classes immediately preceding this project. It was to create a style guide for a website, with the same criteria as this project. We opted to use my partners' overall style for the website, but my checkout design. From here we filled in each of our pages based on these, while also taking inspiration from newegg.ca for anything that wasn’t included in our initial style guide. For this project, I built the checkout, about & contact page. On top of that, I also created the homepage, excluding the “Showcase” section & the hamburger menu, that is displayed on smaller screens.
					</p>
					<h2 class="pro-subheader amaz">Final Project Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						From this project I learned that when working in teams, it is much easier to develop a website when you have a clear idea of what the end goal should be (style guide), then to split up work & build the section of the website separately. I also learned that it would have been better to have a partner that is more design focused because I am more focused on how the website will function & interact, rather than how it is visually designed. For this project, we were both less visual design focused & our end product suffered for it.
