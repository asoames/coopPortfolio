						In teams of 3 (<em>with Rebecca & Nicole</em>), we designed a mobile application to help high school teacher mark assignments. The application needed to use the functionality of one of the sensors of a smartphone in a way that helps the user achieve a task. <br>

					<h2 class="pro-subheader">Description of Solution</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title">Research and Proposals:</h4><p>Our first step was to select a design domain. We picked high school teachers. We then did research to determine the common goal & activities of people in our domain. Following this, we came up with three initial ideas; a swipe-based marking app, an app that makes taking attendance quicker by using location information & a gesture-based app for marking assignments.
</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title">Idea and Interaction Framework:</h4><p>Following feedback from our first presentation, we decided to focus on creating a marking app, combining both of our ideas focusing on marking. At this point, I created a basic sketch of how the app would be laid out, which would be the basis of our design going further.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title">Designing Interactions:</h4>
							<p>We then each developed a higher resolution version (for a total of 3 versions) of how the app would look/function using Illustrator & PhotoShop.</p> 
						</li>

					<ol start="4">
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title">Interactive Prototype:</h4>
							<p>Based on our feedback from our preceding presentation, we selected the design that used minimal text, but used icons to make it functionality clear to users. I used Origami Studio to build this layout for our first prototype. Studio. Some of the roadblocks that we ran into at this stage were:</p>
							<ol class="sub-list">
								<li>
									No member of the team had an osX device, which is the only platform that Origami Studio runs on. To solve this I figured out how to get an osX virtual machine (VM) running on my computer.
								</li>
								<li>
									From our desk critic, we learned that some of the buttons that we used were ambiguous, so we redesigned them to give them a clearer function. 
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							<h4 class="inline-title">Testing & Refining:</h4>
							<p>We performed user testing with our app to determine shortcomings in our design and how to improve them. The majority of our issue centred around ambiguity with icon choice. To solve this we redesigned our icon & added more text-based buttons, rather than icons.</p>
						</li>

					<h2 class="pro-subheader">Final Project Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						The first thing I learned from this was the value of user testing. When user testing starts issues are found, that you, as a developer don't run into. Secondly, I learned the basics of how to use Origami Studio, as I did not know it existed prior to this class. Lastly, I learned that things will go wrong & I just need to recover as gracefully as possible & make decisions as to what is most important to complet
